Hand-written gcode has no slicer to catch you. These are the checks whose failure would either
waste a print or damage something: Z never descends into the part, absolute-E never goes backwards
(that's an un-commanded retraction), nothing leaves the bed, temps are sane, and the travel:extrude
ratio is actually high (if it isn't, we're not making a web).
